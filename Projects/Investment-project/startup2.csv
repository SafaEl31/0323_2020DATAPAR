In May 2008, Practo Technologies was incepted to make the process of accessing health care easier for patients. The company brings seekers and providers of medical expertise on a common platform and also allows digitisation of medical information and history. 

Practo Technologies offers two products: One for patients called Practo.com and another for doctors entitled Ray by Practo. 

Practo.com is a website that allows patients to search for the best doctors in their vicinity as per specialisation. It enables users to make an informed decision by providing critical information about the doctor like his/her qualifications, experience, services offered, reviews etc.

These listings are absolutely free and accessible to doctors and clinics as well as patients which are the USP of this service. Further, it allows patients to look at available slots and book an appointment when required.
 Practo.com also helps patients to digitally store all their medical records and associated history. 

Ray by Practo was launched in India in 2008 followed by its international launch in Singapore in 2013.Practo Ray is a subscription-based SAAS product that Clinics and Healthcare providers use to manage their practice. It looks at automating and bringing in efficiencies for the clinic in managing patient contacts and scheduling appointments. With over 10 million electronic patient records that are doubling every year, Ray by Practo has handled more than 6 million unique patients with over 7.5 million appointments a year. It facilitates communications to patients via SMS and email, creating, storing and 
haring electronic medical records of patients, managing and controlling clinical equipment and supplies for procedures, retailing medicines and drugs in an attached pharmacy and finally giving a combined report and analytics of how the clinic is doing financially. 

Growing in popularity over the years, Practo.com has over 100,000 doctors listed on the site across 310 Indian towns and cities with comprehensive coverage in the 7 major cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Bangalore.
